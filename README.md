# -student-management-system
A beginner-friendly Python web application that helps schools and teachers manage student information digitally. Built with Flask (a simple Python web framework), this system lets you:
What it does:

Add new students - Store student names, ages, grades, and email addresses
View all students - See a complete list of enrolled students
Find specific students - Look up individual student records by ID
Update information - Modify student details when needed
Remove students - Delete records when students leave

How it works:

Uses Python Flask to create a web server
Stores data temporarily in memory (resets when restarted)
Provides REST API endpoints (web URLs that accept data)
Returns information in JSON format (easy-to-read data structure)
Includes error handling for common mistakes
