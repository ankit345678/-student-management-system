# -student-management-system
A beginner-friendly Python web application that helps schools and teachers manage student information digitally. Built with Flask (a simple Python web framework), this system lets you:
What it does:

Add new students - Store student names, ages, grades, and email addresses
View all students - See a complete list of enrolled students
Find specific students - Look up individual student records by ID
Update information - Modify student details when needed
Remove students - Delete records when students leave

How it works:

Uses Python Flask to create a web server
Stores data temporarily in memory (resets when restarted)
Provides REST API endpoints (web URLs that accept data)
Returns information in JSON format (easy-to-read data structure)
Includes error handling for common mistakes

 Technologies Used:

Python 3.11
Flask 2.3.3 - Web framework
Requests 2.31.0 - HTTP client library

Prerequisites:

Python 3.7 or higher
pip (Python package manager)

Installation & Setup:

Install dependencies
bashpip install -r requirements.txt

Run the application
 app.py

Access the API

Server runs on: http://localhost:5000
Automatically loads 30 students from https://dummyjson.com/users
